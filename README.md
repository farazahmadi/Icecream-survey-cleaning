# Icecream-survey-cleaning

This work is a preliminary data analysis task done on a survey data set done on ice cream brands. Its purpose is to clean and prepare the data set using different packages in R so that it can be used most easily by the analysts. This data set accompanies the __“Seven Summits of Marketing Research”__ text by Greg Allenby and Jeff Brazell. This was my first assignment for the Marketing Analysis course I had in fall 2020.

The report is produced using *Rstudio* as an HTML file named main.html, however, the R Markdown file and all appendix files are attached to knit the original R file.

a. Reading the Seven Summits ice cream data
b. Reducing to essential variables needed for analyses
c. Treating missing values
  i. Using the ‘mice’ package for imputing missing values
  ii. Using the ‘sjmisc’ package to merge the 5 datasets into one.
  iii. Comparing the statistics of the original variables against the imputed variables
d. Saving the imputed datasets
e. Recombining the data
f. Renaming the screening, brand assessment, attitude and demographic variables
g. Recoding the variables
h. Saving the data
i. Conclusion
